Version 1.0

Draws blocks, lines and Bezier curves (and later dots and stacked blocks)
from a json structure whose name matches a canvas id. Type of graph is
given by the class name: "blocks", "lines" or "bezier". All sizes, fonts,
etc. are based on the dimensions of the canvas. Executed automatically
by default when the page is loaded.
